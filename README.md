hi!

I like languages, and making things, and making languages which make things.

Currently:

* 🔊 [Bass](https://github.com/vito/bass) ([www](https://bass-lang.org)), a scripting language for reproducible builds and glue code. Replaces YAML, Dockerfiles, and Bash.
* 📖 [Booklit](https://github.com/vito/booklit) ([www](https://booklit.page)), a documentation authoring system I use for all my projects.

Previously:

* ✈️ [Concourse] ([www](https://concourse-ci.org)), a CI/CD system built on declarative YAML. It seemed like a good idea at the time.
* 🌚 [DarcsDen] ([archive](http://web.archive.org/web/20110816083908/http://darcsden.com/alex/darcsden)) - GitHub, but for the [Darcs VCS](http://darcs.net/). It lives on at [Darcs Hub](https://hub.darcs.net/).
* ⚔️ [Aliter], a reverse-engineered server for Ragnarok Online, written in Erlang. If you get a chance to use Erlang, do it!
* 🌱 [Atomy] ([www](https://vito.github.io/atomy/)), a language with an extensible syntax and pattern-matching based macros, targeting [Rubinius].
* ⚛️ [Atomo] ([www](https://vito.github.io/atomo/)), a language inspired by the Smalltalk family of languages - shoutout to [Slate](https://github.com/briantrice/slate-language)!
* 🍿 [Pumice], [Hummus], [Cletus], three equivalent implementations of [Kernel] in different host languages.
* 🍀 [Garden] (+ [Garden Linux]) - a Go rewrite of [Warden], a container engine predating Docker.
* 🐦 [Chyrp], an extensible microblogging framework in PHP. The origin of [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/doc/3.x/templates.html)! (I think. Shoutout to [Armin] who contributed it!)
